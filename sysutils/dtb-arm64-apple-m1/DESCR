The devicetree is a data structure for describing hardware. Rather than
hard coding every detail of a device into an operating system, many aspects
of the hardware can be described in a data structure that is passed to the
operating system at boot time.

This package includes Device Tree Blob (.dtb) files generated from
the Corellium Linux kernel for Apple M1 devices.
