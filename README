pkgsrc is a framework for building software on UNIX-like systems.

To use, bootstrap using:
    cd pkgsrc/bootstrap/
    ./bootstrap

build packages, use:
    cd pkgsrc/category/package-name
    $PREFIX/bin/bmake install

Where $PREFIX is where you've chosen to install packages (typically /usr/pkg)

Bugs and patches can be filed in the follow link (use category 'pkg'):
https://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/sendpr.cgi?gndb=netbsd

To fetch the main CVS repository:
    cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -P pkgsrc

It's also possible to contribute through pkgsrc wip (work in progress), for
